# Byte Lang

**Byte Lang** is an emerging programming language designed to combine the low-level control of assembly language with the readability and structure of high-level languages. Currently in its early stages, Byte Lang offers a foundational set of commands and features aimed at high performance and clear, efficient programming.

## Features

- **Early Development**: Byte Lang is still evolving with a limited set of commands and features.
- **Low-Level Control**: Directly manipulate hardware and system resources with assembly-like syntax.
- **Readable Syntax**: A structured and human-friendly approach to low-level programming.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Since Byte Lang is in its early stages, the installation process involves cloning the repository and building from source:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/byte-lang.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd byte-lang
   ```

3. **Run your first program**:
   ```bash
   cargo run (command)
   ```

### Commands
* run (file location like example.txt)

### Syntax
* print - Prints the provided string or string variable.
* println - Same as print but adds newline at the end.
* string name = value - Creates a new string variable.
* number name = value - Creates a new number variable.
* loop(number) {} - Loops x amount of times.
* compare(number1, number2).=={} .!={}; - Compares two numbers and does things based on the result.
* term - Terminates the program.
* wait(number) - waits .. number of seconds.
* fn [name]() {} - creates a function.
* call [fn name]; - calls a function.
